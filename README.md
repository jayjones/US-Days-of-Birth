# US-Days-of-Birth

The first step in the Data Analyst path is an Introduction to Python:
* Python basics / Syntax
* Working with Files and Loops
* Booleans / If Statements
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Functions

This ended with a guided project doing an analysis of birth date data using a Jupyter notebook.
